dorayaki-childtheme
===================

A childtheme, which adds a dockable menubar to the dorayaki-theme from <a href="http://elmastudio.de">Elmastudio</a>.

Just copy the directory "dorayaki-child-bebehei" to your theme-folder in wordpress and activate it in the backend.
After you've enabled the theme, your menubar docks automatically at the top, before it gets invisible.
If you don't want to use the dockbar anymore, just enable the normal dorayaki-theme from elmastudio instead.

To use this theme, you have to have a legal copy of the Dorayaki-theme from Elmastudio.
This Repository contains a patched headerfile from the dorayaki-theme. This content was produced by Elmastudio, all rights about the headerfile belong to Elmastudio.
